This course addresses some of the important issues involved with the planning, development and implementation of lean enterprises. People, technology, process and information dimensions of an effective lean company will be addressed in a unified framework. Particular emphasis will be placed on the integration of these dimensions across the entire enterprise, including product development, production, and the extended supply chain. Information requirements and technology and process enablers for achieving enterprise integration will be addressed. Analysis and implementation tools as well as future trends and directions will be explored. Outside speakers and industry practitioners will be utilized.

The projects will culminate with a report and presentation of summary recommendations on actions required to transition to a "lean" enterprise.
